# Sample names for gene expression fastqs. If the same libraries were
# sequenced multiple times, just include all the fastq directories in the
# RAW_DATA list and make sure the fastqs from all runs begin with the
# sample name. If gene expression fastqs are not being processed, leave
# this blank.

# Sample groups that should be used with cellranger aggr. Include the gene
# expression names separated by commas for samples that should be
# aggregated together. If only ADT fastqs are being processed, list the
# ADT names. Include multiple entries if multiple groups of samples are
# being aggregated. Leave blank to skip this step.
GROUPS:


# Path to the Cell Ranger genome reference.

# Sample names for CITE-seq and cell hashing fastqs. If both methods were
# used, include both names separated by a comma. CITE-seq and cell hashing
# fastqs will be combined for each sample before running Cell Ranger. If 
# the libraries were sequenced multiple times, just make sure the fastqs 
# from all runs begin with the sample name. If CITE-seq or cell hashing 
# was not performed, leave this blank.

# Sample names for VDJ fastqs. Follow the same parameters required for gene
# expression fastqs. If VDJ sequencing was not performed, leave this blank.
